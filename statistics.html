        <h2>Flight statistics based on FIR/UIR</h2>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        Click on any airspace (FIR/UIR) on the map to display the respective development of the
        number of airline flights during the COVID-19 pandemic. You may select multiple airspaces
        at the same time. Clicking a second time on the same airspace deselects
        it. Switching between FIRs and UIRs on the map is done via the legend.
        The view can be toggled between absolute numbers and a percentage
        related to the average number of flights in the first ten days of the
        year 2020.
        <h3>Content</h3>
        Some regions don't discriminate between FIR and UIR or
        have been simplified due to a lack of reliable openly available shape
        files and to save computation power in data processing.
        Aircraft position data was consumed as state vectors from the
        <a href='https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/'>OpenSky Network API</a>
        as well as from the
        <a href='https://opensky-network.org/data/impala'>
            OpenSky Network historical database</a>
        at intervals between 10 seconds and 5 minutes.
        State vectors with incomplete positional information or on_ground state
        were ignored.
        This statistics is focused on airline flights and should ignore general
        aviation. Only callsigns matching the following regular expression have
        been processed:
        <code>^([A-Z]{3})[0-9](([0-9]{0,3})|([0-9]{0,2})([A-Z])|([0-9]?)([A-Z]{2}))$</code>

        <h2>World wide statistics</h2>
        <div id="world_statistics"></div>
        The flight statistics is based on <a href="https://opensky-network.org/">OpenSky Network</a>
        data and was processed as described above.
        <br>
        For simplicity, the COVID-19 related data is shown for the whole
        world only. Much more information can be found at the source of the
        dataset:
